# Majudge

This is a majority judgement algorithm written in Elixir.  It will probably become a very specific majority judgement Phoenix site where my friends can vote 

## Running

Just run `mix` and then run `iex -S mix` to load the code up in your editor.

## Testing

Run `mix test` to run the unit tests.
