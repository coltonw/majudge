# Majudge - [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/coltonw/majudge.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/coltonw/majudge)

This is a majority judgement algorithm written in Elixir. It will probably become a very specific majority judgement Phoenix site where my friends can vote

## Running

To start the Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
